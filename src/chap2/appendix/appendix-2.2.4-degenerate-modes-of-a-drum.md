## 2.2.4 : Degenerate modes of a drum {#degenerate-modes-of-a-drum}

For the drum mode discussed in the main text, with a single nodal
diameter, the displacement around a circle of constant radius on the
drum varies like $\cos \theta$, where $\theta$ is the usual polar
coordinate angle. The second incarnation of the mode varies like $\sin
\theta$. (Recall that both are vibrating at the same frequency, so we
don't need to write down the time dependence because it is the same for
everything.) Now suppose we have the mixture
$a\cos\theta+b\sin\theta$. Choose $r$ and $\phi$ so that
$a=r\cos\phi$ and $b=r\sin\phi$. Then the combination is $r
\left(\cos\phi \cos\theta+\sin\phi
\sin\theta\right)=r\cos\left(\theta-\phi \right)$, the same
pattern rotated by angle $\phi$.
